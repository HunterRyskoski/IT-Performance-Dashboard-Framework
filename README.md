## Project Overview

Modern IT teams generate large volumes of service requests, yet many organizations lack clear visibility into performance trends and workload distribution.

This dashboard framework was developed to:

- Track ticket volume by category
- Monitor average completion time trends
- Analyze service channel distribution
- Evaluate workload allocation patterns
- Support performance discussions with measurable data

The result is a centralized, executive-ready reporting structure built using Power BI and structured data modeling.
